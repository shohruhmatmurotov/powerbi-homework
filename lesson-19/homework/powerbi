1. What is the difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Online Service?
Power BI Desktop is a Windows application used to build reports and data models. Power BI Online Service (also called Power BI Service) is the web-based platform where you publish, share, view, and manage your reports and dashboards. Desktop is for development; Service is for collaboration and consumption.

2. How do you publish a Power BI report from Desktop to the Online Service?
After building your report in Power BI Desktop, click File > Publish > To Power BI. Sign in, choose a workspace (like "My Workspace" or a shared one), and the report and its dataset will be uploaded to the Power BI Service.

3. What is a workspace in Power BI? What are the types of workspaces available?
A workspace is a collaborative area in Power BI Service where reports, datasets, dashboards, and dataflows are organized. There are two types:

My Workspace – your personal space.

Shared/Professional Workspaces – where teams can collaborate and publish apps.

4. What is the difference between a workspace and an app in Power BI?
A workspace is a place to build and manage content. An app is a packaged version of that content, shared with others for viewing. Workspaces are for developers/editors; apps are for end users to consume content easily.

5. Explain the different Power BI license types and their limitations.
Free: Only for personal use in Desktop. No sharing or collaboration in Service.

Pro: Required for sharing and collaboration. Limited to 1 GB dataset size and 8 scheduled refreshes per day.

Premium: Meant for enterprises. Allows larger datasets, 48 refreshes/day, paginated reports, and enables sharing with free users.

6. How can you share a report with someone who doesn’t have a Pro license?
You can publish the report in a Premium workspace. Reports in Premium workspaces can be viewed by free users, as long as they have access to the app or report.

7. What is a semantic model (dataset) in Power BI, and where is it stored in the service?
A semantic model (called a dataset) is the data model you create in Power BI Desktop — including tables, relationships, measures, etc. When you publish your report, this model is uploaded to Power BI Service and stored in the workspace you choose.

8. How does Scheduled Refresh work in Power BI Online Service?
Scheduled refresh automatically updates your dataset at set intervals (daily or hourly). It’s configured in the Service under the dataset settings. You need a Pro or Premium license, and a gateway if the source is on-premises.

9. What is the difference between a dataset and a dataflow in Power BI?
A dataset is the data model used for visuals and reports, typically created in Power BI Desktop. A dataflow is a Power BI Service feature that performs data transformation in the cloud and stores clean tables you can reuse across datasets.

10. When and why would you use a dataflow instead of a dataset?
Use dataflows when:

You want to prepare and transform data once and reuse it in multiple datasets.

You want centralized ETL logic shared across teams.

You’re working in the cloud and want to avoid local Power BI Desktop ETL steps.

11. What are dashboards in Power BI Online? How are they different from reports?
A dashboard is a single-page canvas made of pinned visuals from one or more reports. It’s good for high-level summaries. Reports are more detailed, multi-page, and interactive.

12. How do you pin a visual to a dashboard from a report?
In a report, hover over the visual you want to pin and click the pin icon. Then choose to add it to a new or existing dashboard.

13. What is the mobile view in Power BI and why is it useful?
Mobile view lets you arrange report visuals to look good on mobile devices. It's important because phones have smaller screens, and good layout ensures better user experience.

14. What is a paginated report in Power BI and when would you use it?
Paginated reports are used for print-ready, pixel-perfect layouts (e.g., invoices or regulatory reports). You use them when your reports span multiple pages and need exact formatting. They are built using Power BI Report Builder and require a Premium license.

15. Can you export reports from Power BI Service to PDF or PowerPoint? How?
Yes. In Power BI Service, open the report, click File > Export and choose PDF or PowerPoint. This is useful for sharing snapshots of reports with people who don’t have Power BI access.

16. What does “Live Connection” mean in Power BI Service, and how does it work?
A Live Connection means Power BI doesn't import data — it queries the data source (like SSAS or another dataset) directly. The data stays in the source and updates in real time when you open the report.

17. Explain Row-Level Security (RLS) and how it’s applied in Power BI Online.
RLS restricts what data a user can see, based on roles defined in Power BI Desktop (using filters). After publishing, you assign users to these roles in Power BI Service under the dataset’s Security settings.

18. How can you test RLS roles in Power BI Service?
Go to the dataset in Power BI Service, click the ellipsis (three dots), choose Security, and select View As Role to test what each role can see.

19. What are Apps in Power BI and how do you publish one?
Apps are a packaged set of dashboards and reports you publish from a workspace. To publish:

Go to the workspace.

Click Publish App.

Choose which content to include and who to share it with.

Users can access it via a link or the Apps section in Power BI.

20. What are some key benefits of using the Power BI Online Service in enterprise environments?
Centralized access and governance.

Scheduled data refreshes.

Role-based security.

Easy sharing and collaboration.

Integration with Microsoft 365, Teams, SharePoint, Excel.

Scalability using Premium capacity.
